# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create two csv files. One that details the number of retiring employees by title and another with the employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Results
### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- 6,138 Senior Engineers are retiring

## Summary 
- 16,981 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact
- 1,549 Employees are ready to menor the next generation of employees but that is not nearly enough to cover the possible amount of new employees that will start once the "silver tsunami" retirement period starts.
